801 contain the last edited alignments

305 contain both summary and post-op last edited

The surgical procedure can be broken into
	robot      vs. no robot
	makoplasty vs. no makoplasty
	left 	   vs. right          vs. bilateral
	revision   vs. no revision

24 unique surgeon names: 
	will there be new surgeons added to the list?

Questions
	Are the summaray images all done on the same knee?
	Why are there some summary images with no corresponding last edited implant?
	What do the four Femoral rotation degrees represent (Coronal, PCA TEA, Sagittal)? Photos for better understanding?
	How can I tell if the results from the operation were successful?

-----------------------------------
In meeting

All done on same knee

Import errors, some have no summary screen

Summary and planning screens are redundant - same thing

Planning : PCA only, 


Need all four angles to get a complete alignment of the knee.

Flexion (femoral) and p.slope (tibial) sort of same

LAST EDITED is the END

AS-SCANNED correlates to pre-op

Only pre-op alignment data and the resections


ENDPOINT: dataset on the left - WHAT WE ENDED UP WITH

PLANNED: what we WANT before surgery

WHEN LAST EDITED NOT APPARENT, CAN USE SUMMARY

FOCUS ON THE PRE-OP ONES, SUMMARY SCREEN

HOW WELL DID SURGERY GO??

-------------
9 types of morphology: all you need is MPTA and LDFA - THIS IS PREOP
-------------

-> where they ended up is LAST EDITED

- ahka, jlo only for 356 cases -> preop CPAC
- calculate ahka, jlo for 852 -> 

ASSUMING THESE SURGEONS HAVE GENERALLY GOOD OUTCOMES, IS THERE A PATTERN IN HOW THEY MAKE THE RESECTIONS???

EX: DON'T NEED TO GO XXmm OUTSIDE THE TIBIA IF AKHA IS LESS THAN xx

Clustering: clusters of postop morphologies that share preop morphologies 

- can we classify how morphologies change pre and post alignment?

----
Don't use as-scanned: use AV-BC, Q-W

AHKA: use +- 1 for verus or valgus measurements
JLO: use +- 2

-: verus, +: valgus
