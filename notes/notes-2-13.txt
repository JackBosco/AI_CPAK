Watson

- linear regression (with polynomial fit) doesn't work: not a linear relation between bmi, preop alignments etc. and predictive aHKA
	-> use an SVM regression (lots of control: linear, polynomial, n-dimensional, easy to code)
	-> small feed-foreward NN (1 hidden layer, coned BIG Medium small)

- clustering: k-nearest neighbor? not sure what that will be useful for
- not clear what the value of the clusters are
	-> cluster pre-op together, choose colors for different groups, see where they land on post-op
	go through each group, link the inputs to outputs on a graph

- embedding the bias of the surgeons into the model
- model just gives a learned pattern over what the doctors have already done
	-> limitation: we don't have the ability to predict real-world alignments
	-> model doesn't hold better than the predictions that are already being made

======================= TODO ========================
- make models, show report (on a PDF)
	loss over epoc
	determine threshold of accuracy for aHKA (dr. meftah)
	clustering
	ROC curve (precision vs. recall with random in the middle)
