Deep Learning: Automatic feature engineering, representations built with layers

Canonical ML: better when we have less data

Sequential and Recursive feature analysis, feature importance values <- decision tree split by WHAT?

FOR NEXT Tuesday: 
1) learn standard scalar stuff https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html
2) why is SVM beneficial? Is there anything better for regression given we want to approximate aHKA?

FOR Conversation with Doctors at 2:00
1) understand their desire (pretend it is candyland)
2) these post-op values are predicitions based on Doctor's knowledge, is it useful to predict predictions?
3) does the k-clustering tell us anything
	- "I'm not sure what you are attempting to learn from this clustering"
	- clustering input and output together v.s. seperating
	- what am I trying to gain insight into with the clustering
